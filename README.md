This is a project based on Net Ninja's React Native Tutorial, a app that shows game reviews and my ratings for them.
https://github.com/iamshaunjp is his git hub and I wanna credit him for the inspiration to take it further. 
The course files for his tutorial are https://github.com/iamshaunjp/react-native-tutorial and his youtube channel is absolute amazing
for the knowledge I gained.
